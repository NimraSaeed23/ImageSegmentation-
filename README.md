# ImageSegmentation

This project demonstrates the use of unsupervised learning techniques, specifically k-means clustering, to perform image segmentation. It aims to simplify images by reducing the number of colors to predefined clusters, making it easier to analyze images or extract useful information from them.

## Description

Image segmentation is a crucial process in computer vision, useful in areas like medical imaging, self-driving cars, and machine inspection. This project uses Python libraries such as NumPy, and Matplotlib to segment images based on color similarity. The primary goal is to identify distinct color regions and reduce the overall color palette of an image, thereby segmenting it into meaningful parts.

## Features

- Color segmentation using k-means clustering.
- Interactive web interface using Streamlit to upload images and select the number of clusters.
- Visualization of the original and segmented images.
- Elbow method implementation to suggest the optimal number of clusters.
